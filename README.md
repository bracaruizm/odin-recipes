# odin-recipes
This is part of the Odin Proyect exercises

"Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)"


>It’s time to put all of the HTML knowledge you have been acquiring so far into practice. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

>The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 

>But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS."

I will be building a modest website with the basics of HTML. I hope I can do well! Hopefully after finishing this task I will jump straightforward into CSS. Let's go! 2 hs per day studying will make the real difference! It's a matter of commitment and effort. Let's go! :D
