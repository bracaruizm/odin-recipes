    <p class="recipe-body"> This is the how-to-cook guide for hotdogs!</p> 
    <p class="recipe-body"> A hotdog is a food consisting of a grilled or steamed sausage served in the slit <br>
        of a partially sliced bun.[4] The term hot dog can also refer to the sausage itself.<br>
        The sausage used is a wiener (Vienna sausage) or a frankfurter <br>
        (Frankfurter WÃ¼rstchen, also just called frank). The names of these sausages also commonly <br>
        refer to their assembled dish.</p>
